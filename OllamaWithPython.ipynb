That\\'s kinda what the Earth does with everything on it. It gives them a gentle squeeze.\\n\\nImagine you have a ball, and you throw it up in the air. What happens? The ball comes back down to your hand, right? That\\'s because the Earth is giving it a hug, pulling it towards itself. This is called gravity.\\n\\nGravity is what keeps us on the ground, what makes things fall down when we drop them, and even what holds our atmosphere (the air around us) close to the Earth. It\\'s like the Earth is saying, \"Hey, stay close to me! I\\'ve got you!\"\\n\\nSo, whenever something has mass (like a rock or a person), it pulls on everything else with gravity. And that\\'s why we don\\'t float off into space when we\\'re standing on the ground â€“ the Earth\\'s gravity is giving us a big hug!\\n\\nHow was that explanation?
